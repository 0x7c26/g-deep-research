## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these steps to get Deep Research up and running on your local browser.

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 18.18.0 or later recommended)
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) or [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/u14app/deep-research.git
   cd deep-research
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   pnpm install  # or npm install or yarn install
   ```

3. **Set up Environment Variables:**

   Create a `.env` or `.env.local` file in the root directory of your project and configure the following environment variables:

   ```env
   # Server-side Gemini API Key (Required for server API calls)
   GOOGLE_GENERATIVE_AI_API_KEY=YOUR_GOOGLE_GENERATIVE_AI_API_KEY

   # (Optional) Server API Proxy URL
   API_PROXY_BASE_URL=YOUR_API_PROXY_URL

   # (Optional) Server API Access Password for enhanced security
   ACCESS_PASSWORD=YOUR_ACCESS_PASSWORD
   ```

   **Important Notes on Environment Variables:**

   - `GOOGLE_GENERATIVE_AI_API_KEY`: **Required for using the server-side API.** You need to obtain a Google Generative AI API key from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/). This key should be kept secret and **never committed to your public repository.**
   - `API_PROXY_BASE_URL`: **Optional.** If you need to use a proxy server for API requests, configure this variable with your proxy server's base URL. This is relevant for server-side API calls.
   - `ACCESS_PASSWORD`: **Optional but highly recommended for server-side deployments.** Set a strong password to protect your server-side API endpoints. This password will be required to access server-side API functionalities.

   **Privacy Reminder:** These environment variables are primarily used for **server-side API calls**. When using the **local API mode**, no API keys or server-side configurations are needed, further enhancing your privacy.

4. **Run the development server:**

   ```bash
   pnpm dev  # or npm run dev or yarn dev
   ```

   Open your browser and visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to access Deep Research.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

As mentioned in the "Getting Started" section, Deep Research utilizes the following environment variables for server-side API configurations:

- `GOOGLE_GENERATIVE_AI_API_KEY`
- `API_PROXY_BASE_URL`
- `ACCESS_PASSWORD`

These variables are **only required if you intend to use the server-side API calling functionality.** For local API calls, no configuration is necessary beyond setting up the project.

## üõ°Ô∏è Privacy

Deep Research is designed with your privacy in mind. **All research data and generated reports are stored locally on your machine.** We do not collect or transmit any of your research data to external servers (unless you are explicitly using server-side API calls, in which case data is sent to Google's Gemini API through your configured proxy if any). Your privacy is our priority.
